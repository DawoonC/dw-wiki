# DW WIKI
A wiki page for the final project of Web Development course at Udacity.

## Notes for the codes in the project
Most of codes for the handlers were taught by Steve Huffman during the Web Development course, and I used Google Web Starter Kit template for my base HTML page. Only few were written by my self.
