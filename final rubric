# you can go to any url, and if the url does not exist,
  it will redirect to another url
  e.g.) /newpage -> redirect to -> /_edit/newpage
  	   (not exist)					(edit page with the input title)

  	   after edit, it will redirect to created /newpage
  	   # created page must be editable

# to edit the page, user must be logged in
# if the user is not logged in or logged out, the page is only for view
